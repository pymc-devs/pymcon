  </a>
</div>

We value the participation of each member of the PyMC community and want all attendees to
have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to
show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all
conference events, whether officially sponsored by PyMC or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers at
PyMCon event are required to conform to the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct. Organizers will
enforce this code throughout the event.

We reproduce here certain portions of the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct that are specifically
relevant to PyMCon. We encourage all PyMCon participants to review the complete
Code of Conduct.

## The Shorter Version

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that
harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes and language are not appropriate for
PyMCon.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of
many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

PyMCon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
participants in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

## Code of Conduct Highlights Specific to PyMCon

We reproduce here certain portions of the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct that are specifically
relevant to PyMCon. We encourage all PyMCon participants to review the complete Code of
Conduct.

### How to Report

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, please report this in a timely
manner. Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of the community for everyone and we
take them seriously.

You can make a personal or anonymous report by:

* **By Email**: Send a message to any or all Diversity Chairs, which can be reached at
  oriol.abril.pla@gmail.com and andorra.alexandre@gmail.com. Event organizers will respond
  promptly.
* **On Slack**: Join the [PyMCon Slack](https://pymcon.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-fk9efmvb-SWvT01TOnykgzFmLgn1iAw)
  and contact with the Diversity Chairs, Oriol Abril or Alex Andorra.
* **Online Form**: A variant of the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Report is available for
  PyMCon [here](https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/kMgloi8t) (your name and contact
  information are not required).

During PyMCon, we recommend contacting via email or Slack so we can take
immediate action if necessary. In addition to contacting directly with the Diversity
committee, we also encourages you to make a report using our reporting form.

To file a report anonymously please use the [online form](https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/kMgloi8t).

### What to include in a report

Our ability to address any Code of Conduct breaches in a timely and effective manner
is impacted by the amount of information you can provide, so our reporting form asks you
to include as much of the following information as you can:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up). This will
  be kept confidential. If you wish to remain anonymous, your information will not be
  shared beyond the person receiving the initial report.
* The approximate time and location of the incident (please be as specific as possible)
* Identifying information (e.g. name, nickname, screen name, physical description) of the
  individual whose behavior is being reported
* Description of the behavior (if reporting harassing language, please be specific about
  the words used), your account of what happened, and any available supporting records
  (e.g. email, GitHub issue, screenshots, etc.). The online form supports
  attaching up to 5 files and email and Slack have not limit.
* Description of the circumstances/context surrounding the incident. Let us know if the
  incident is ongoing, and/or if this is part of an ongoing pattern of behavior
* Names and contact info, if possible, of anyone else who witnessed or was involved in
  this incident. (Did anyone else observe the incident?)
* Any other relevant information you believe we should have

_The Diversity committee will attempt to gather and write down the above information from
anyone making a verbal report. Recording the details in writing is exceedingly important
in order for us to effectively respond to reports. If event staff write down a report
taken verbally, then the person making the report will be asked to review the written
report for accuracy._

### Enforcement

At PyMCon, if a participant engages in behavior that violates the Code of Conduct, the
conference organizers and staff may take any action they deem appropriate.

Potential consequences for violating the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct at PyMCon include:

  sanctions

  the remainder of the event

  a certain time period)
* Expelling the person from the event without a refund
* Banning the person from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* Any other response that the organizing committee deems necessary and appropriate to
  the situation

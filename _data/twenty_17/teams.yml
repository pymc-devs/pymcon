  topic: Trying to keep an open yet skeptical mind by contributing to open source software+statistics
  description: Oriol is a research assistant on Bayesian model selection on generalized linear models
    at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona). His work there with David Rossell is available as part
    of the R/C++ package mombf. He is passionate about Bayesian statistics, open science and
    reproducibility. He is an ArviZ core contributor and tries to contribute to the PyData ecosystem
    and the greater Bayesian community. He has just started a blog on Bayesian statistics and open
    source software at oriolabril.github.io

  topic: Ravin is a proponent of open source, but more importantly open knowledge and the communities that surround them.
  description: Ravin Kumar is a senior engineer that uses data and statistics to inform humans decision making from C Suite long term strategy to ground floor “in the moment” choices. Ravin is (likely) a big proponent of Bayesian statistics and is Core Contributor to PyMC3 and ArviZ. Both are Open Source projects that strive to make Bayesian methods accessible and easy to use and for anybody. Ravin also helps plan community conferences such as PyDataLA, and enjoys building people up as much as he enjoys building code.

  topic: Advocate for Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming
  description: Thomas discovered the power of Bayesian statistics during his PhD at Brown University where it provided an invaluable tool in building computational models of the human brain to deepen our understanding of psychiatric illnesses. After his PhD he spent several years at Quantopian as the VP of Data Science to lead their research efforts in building the world\'s first crowd-sourced hedge fund. These days he is building a PyMC consultancy as well as developing an <a href="https://twiecki.io/pages/an-intuitive-guide-to-bayesian-statistics.html">intuitions-first course on Bayesian statistics</a>.

  topic: International Development. Statistics/data science for international development. Sounds more confident than he is.
  description: "As Director, Sid provides technical and thought leadership within the data science team. He is responsible for growing the data science capability within IDinsight, and oversees the design and development of all data science projects.

Prior to joining IDinsight, Sid worked as a data scientist at QuantumBlack, McKinsey’s advanced analytics arm; Coles, a supermarket chain in Australia; and the Center for International Development at Harvard. He worked in public health for the Clinton Health Access Initiative where he helped countries scale access to diagnostics, and developed global forecasts to inform pricing negotiations for sub-Saharan Africa. Sid enjoys using a wide range of statistical methods to inform policy, and recently discovered that he is a closet Bayesian. His previous projects have involved large-scale predictive analytics, optimisation, and Bayesian inference.

Sid holds a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from the University of Melbourne, and an MPA in International Development (MPA/ID) from Harvard Kennedy School. He speaks English, Hindi, and Telugu.

Sid was born in New Delhi and did a large share of his growing up in Melbourne. He has lived and worked in a number of developing countries, including Uganda, Ghana, India, and Papua New Guinea. He now lives in Boston with his wife and spends his evenings chasing after his two toddlers."

  description: By day, Alex is a data scientist trying to implement Bayesian models at the French firm Societe.com. By night, he doesn’t (yet) fight crime, but he’s an open-source enthusiast and core contributor to the python packages PyMC and ArviZ. Alex is also the creator and host of the only podcast dedicated to Bayesian statistics, “Learning Bayesian Statistics”. Every fortnight, he interviews practitioners of all fields about why and how they use Bayesian statistics. He also loves Nutella a bit too much, but he doesn’t like talking about it -- he prefers eating it.

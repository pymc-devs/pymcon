  topic: A Novel Bayesian Model to Fit Spectrophotometric Data of Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes
  proposal_summary: Understanding how the most massive galaxies rapidly formed and quenched when Universe was only ~3 billion years old is one of the major challenges of extragalactic astronomy.
    In this talk, I will discuss how to improve our understanding of massive galaxy formation by combining the spectro-photometric observations of the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes for strong gravitationally lensed galaxies.
    In particular, a multi-level regression model is built that can fit all multi-wavelength data for a range of instruments within a hierarchical Bayesian framework to constrain the properties of the stellar populations.
    The details of how this model is implemented using PyMC3, as well as the estimates of the posteriors of all parameters of interest and nuisance parameters will be highlighted.

  topic: "calibr8: Going beyond linear ranges with non-linear calibration curves and multilevel modeling"
  proposal_summary: "You just coded up a beautiful model and dummy prediction looks great.
    Now comes the data, but wait: the units don't match!
    And to make matters worse, the correlation between model variable and measurement readout is non-linear and heteroscedastic!
    Sounds familiar? non-linear calibration to the rescue! With `calibr8`, we present a statistical framework and corresponding open source Python package that solves non-linear calibration and likelihood functions for modeling.
    From a laboratory automation and systems biology perspective, the advantage of non-linear calibration with `calibr8` is two-fold:
    For lab scientists doing (high-throughput) experiments, `calibr8` facilitates more intuitive uncertainty quantification and makes every-day data analysis more robust, automatable and Bayesian.
    From a modeling perspective, non-linear _error models_ are essential components of realistic Bayesian process models, and are key to accurately describe the nastiest step of the data-generating process.
    In this talk, we will take you step-by-step through the data-generating process of an automated bioassay and demonstrate how its non-linearities are modeled with `calibr8`.
    We will show how `calibr8` can make your life easier - and of course more Bayesian - even if you don't always go all the way to a process model.
    Finally, we will show how non-linear error models and multi-level modeling with `PyMC3` enable you to get more information out of heterogeneous regression analyses.
    Join us for the talk and discussion to learn about building Bayesian models for bioassays and dive into the fascinatingly frightening world of non-linear measurement errors!"

  topic: "Bayesian Machine Learning: A PyMC-Centric Introduction"
  proposal_summary: At the heart of any machine learning (ML) problem is the identification of models that explain the data well,
    where learning about the model parameters, treated as random variables, is integral.

    Bayesian methods therefore play an important role in many aspects of ML.
    This introductory talk aims to highlight some of the most prominent areas in Bayesian ML from the perspective of statisticians and analysts,
    drawing parallels between these areas and common problems that Bayesian statisticians work on.

    From a laboratory automation and systems biology perspective, the advantage of non-linear calibration with `calibr8` is two-fold:
    For lab scientists doing (high-throughput) experiments, `calibr8` facilitates more intuitive uncertainty quantification and makes every-day data analysis more robust, automatable and Bayesian.
    From a modeling perspective, non-linear _error models_ are essential components of realistic Bayesian process models, and are key to accurately describe the nastiest step of the data-generating process.
    In this talk, we will take you step-by-step through the data-generating process of an automated bioassay and demonstrate how its non-linearities are modeled with `calibr8`.
    We will show how `calibr8` can make your life easier - and of course more Bayesian - even if you don't always go all the way to a process model.
    Finally, we will show how non-linear error models and multi-level modeling with `PyMC3` enable you to get more information out of heterogeneous regression analyses.
    Join us for the talk and discussion to learn about building Bayesian models for bioassays and dive into the fascinatingly frightening world of non-linear measurement errors!"

  description: "Michael Osthege is a biotech Bayesian by choice.
    He likes to work with robots, bacteria and models as much as he loves to work in enthusiastic teams.
    As a PhD student in laboratory automation for bioprocess development at Forschungszentrum Jülich, he writes software to make robots generate his data.
    Since he unit-tests his code, he always blames the robots if the data doesn't agree with his Bayesian models."

  topic: "Posterior Predictive Sampling in PyMC3"
  proposal_summary: "PyMC3 is great for inferring parameter values in a model given some observations, but sometimes we also want to generate random samples from the model as predictions given what we already inferred from the observed data. This kind of sampling is called posterior predictive sampling, and it can be very hard. The typical problems that show up are related to shape mismatches in hierarchical models, latent categorical values that aren’t correctly re-sampled or changing the shape of the data between the training and test phases. In this presentation I’ll talk about how posterior predictive sampling is implemented in PyMC3, show some typical situations where it fails, and how to make it work."

  topic: Estimating the Causal Network of Developmental Neurotoxicants using PyMC3
  proposal_summary: There is a vital need for alternative methods to animal testing to assess compounds for their potency of inducing developmental neurotoxicity such as learning disabilities in children.
    However, data are often limited and complex in structure. Therefore, Bayesian approaches are perfect to unravel their meaning and create predictive models.
    In this talk, I will showcase a multilevel probabilistic model and outline how to deal with unbalanced, correlated and missing values.
    This presentation will be of interest for those willing to learn multilevel modelling in PyMC3,
    how to deal with missing values for both predictors and outcomes of data matrices,
    and their application to a real problem in toxicology.
